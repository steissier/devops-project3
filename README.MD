# Devops Project 3 : Django webapp CICD

## 1- Goal

The goal of this project is to verify your ability to automate build and deploy containerized applications.
In fact the most completed your pipeline will be, the most higher will be your rating.
The rule is simple: Use at least all the recommended tools for this exercise to create your pipeline.
The most appreciated pipeline need to implement the following pattern :
```
 build ->  Test -> scan -> push -> Deploy (Prod and  Preprod) -> Test -> Monitor
```
But you don't have to implement all the steps above.

## 2- Recommended Tools

- Gitlab-CI/Jenkins
- docker-compose
- snyk
- Ansible
- Terraform (Optional)
- ssh

For the docker-compose.yml file (which will be used for deployment), please see the file below and get inspiration from it

```
version: '3.3'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    expose:
      - "8000"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    links:
      - postgres
  postgres:
    image: postgres:9
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
```      

## 3- Build

For build step you need to produce a Dockerfile to containerize application.
For this project we recommend you **python:3** for base image

## 4- Security

The security is an important aspect of this project, please make sure that you keep in mind security bests practises when you write script or any other action you made, because we will pay a special attention to that went we will review your work

## 5- Delivrable

At the end of the project you must provide us:
- A documentation of your work with screenshots
- A Powerpoint the present your work to the audience
- All your source through a documented GitHub repo

## 6- Have Fun

Feel free to add some extra steps, extra tools to make your pipeline more powerful (code analysis, so on and so forth)
We want you to enjoy yourself in this project and explore new possibility offers by the devops world
